🖥️ OPTION 1: Create a Folder Directly on GitHub Website

Go to your repository:
👉 https://github.com/sureshbabubug22cs-prog/Laptop-Request-Catalog-Item

Click the “Add file” → “Create new file” button.

In the filename box, type the folder name, then a /, and then a file name.
For example:

scripts/setup.sh


This creates a folder named scripts with a file setup.sh inside.

Add some content (even a single line), then click “Commit new file”.

✅ Done — the folder scripts now exists in your repo.

⚠️ Note: GitHub doesn’t allow empty folders — each folder must contain at least one file.
